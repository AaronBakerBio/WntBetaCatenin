# Mathematical Model of Wnt Signaling in Vertebrate Embryogenesis

This repository contains a recreation and adaptation of the models described in the paper:
- "A Mathematical Modelling Portrait of Wnt Signalling in Early Vertebrate Embryogenesis" by Claudiu V. Giuraniuc et al.

The models originally described in Mathematica have been independently implemented in Python by Aaron Baker, a graduate student at Tufts University (2024). This repository also includes additional simulations and adaptations to explore the effects of Axin2 upregulation and downregulation, as well as BMP + WNT8a overexpression.

## Contributions
This repository represents a recreation and adaptation of the original models into a new programming language (Python) for accessibility and further exploration. All adaptations, extensions, and additional functionality in this repository were developed solely by Aaron Baker. 

## Attribution
- **Original Work**: Proper credit must be given to Claudiu V. Giuraniuc et al. for their original models and scientific contributions.
- **This Adaptation**: Proper attribution should also be given to Aaron Baker for this Python adaptation, recreation, and extended simulations.

For any reuse or reproduction of this repository, please ensure appropriate attribution to both the original authors and Aaron Baker.
